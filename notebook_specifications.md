*   Document model governance artifacts.

**Expected Outcomes:**

*   A Jupyter Notebook environment that allows users to:
    *   Load and run pre-trained LGD models.
    *   Validate model performance using various statistical and economic tests.
    *   Identify potential issues with data quality and model stability.
    *   Generate reports and documentation to support model governance.

## 2. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Loss Given Default (LGD)

**Definition:** LGD represents the economic loss incurred if a borrower defaults on a loan. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure at default (EAD).
$$ LGD = \frac{Loss\ Amount}{EAD} $$
where
$$ Loss\ Amount = EAD - Recoveries $$

**Real-World Applications:**
LGD is a crucial parameter in credit risk management, used for:
*   Regulatory capital calculations.
*   Loan pricing and provisioning.
*   Portfolio stress testing.

### 2.2 Exposure at Default (EAD)

**Definition:** EAD represents the outstanding balance of a loan at the time of default.
$$ EAD = Outstanding\ Principal + Accrued\ Interest - Any\ Prepayments $$

**Real-World Applications:**
EAD is used in conjunction with LGD and Probability of Default (PD) to calculate Expected Loss (EL).

### 2.3 Present Value of Recoveries

**Definition:** The sum of all recoveries (net of costs) discounted back to the default date using the loan's effective interest rate.
$$ PV_{Recoveries} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{R_t}{(1+r)^t} $$
where:

*   $R_t$ is the recovery amount at time $t$.
*   $r$ is the effective interest rate.
*   $n$ is the number of recovery periods.

### 2.4 Population Stability Index (PSI)

**Definition:** PSI quantifies the change in the distribution of a variable between two time periods.  It's used to assess model stability over time.
$$ PSI = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Actual\%_i - Expected\%_i) * ln(\frac{Actual\%_i}{Expected\%_i}) $$
where:

*   $N$ is the number of categories or bins.
*   $Actual\%_i$ is the percentage of observations in bin *i* in the current period.
*   $Expected\%_i$ is the percentage of observations in bin *i* in the baseline period.

A PSI value greater than 0.1 typically indicates a significant shift in the distribution and warrants further investigation.

### 2.5 Calibration and Back-testing

**Calibration:** Calibration assesses how well a model's predictions align with actual outcomes.  In the context of LGD, it involves comparing the predicted LGDs with the realized LGDs.

**Back-testing:** Back-testing evaluates a model's performance on historical data to assess its accuracy and stability.  It is used to identify potential biases or weaknesses in the model.

### 2.6 Beta Regression

**Definition:** A regression model used when the dependent variable is continuous and bounded between 0 and 1 (like LGD expressed as a percentage). The dependent variable follows a Beta distribution.

### 2.7 Pseudo-R²

**Definition:** Since the traditional $R^2$ does not apply to models with non-normal errors (such as Beta Regression) a pseudo-R² is often used. There are various forms of pseudo-R², measuring the goodness of fit of statistical models.
